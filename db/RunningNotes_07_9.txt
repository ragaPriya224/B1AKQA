super set of candidate key i.e., Candidate key + non key attribute


Entities 
▪Entities are specific objects or things that are represented in the database.Example: The Student , the Book

types: 

Types of Entities

Strong/Regular Entity

▪It can exist independently of other types of entities▪
It has its own unique identifierExample: The Student Entity can exist independent of any other entitles

Weak Entity
▪It is dependent on a strong entity (identifying owner)...cannot exist on its own
▪It does not have a unique identifier (only a partial identifier)Example:Nominee Entity cannot exist independent of Policy-Holder Entity


Types of attributes
•Simple Vs Composite
•Single valued Vs Multi-valued
•Simple attribute
-----------------
eAn attribute, which cannot be sub-divided further components Example: Age,  Sex.
These attributes cannot be divided into subcomponents 

•Composite attribute
---------------------
Attribute may be composed of several components
Example: Address, Name.  
Address attributes can be composted of door no., street, city, state, whereas Name can compose of First Name, Last Name


Types of attributes        

Single valued attribute
An attribute, which has only single atomic valuesExample: Age,  DOB, Sex. These attribute values are single and atomic•
Multi-valued attribute
An Attribute may have multiple valuesExample: Attribute Degree can have values ‘B.Tech’  and ‘M.Tech’, attribute hobby can have values ‘playing cricket’ and ‘watching cricket’


---------------------------------
mapping

one to one
one to many
