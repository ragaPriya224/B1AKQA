PILLARS OF FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE: 


https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/overview-summary.html

1.CONSUMER -> single argument as input , not return anything
2.PREDICATE -> single argument as input, return BOOLEAN 
3. FUNCTION -> one argument as input, another as output,
4. SUPPLIER -> NO argument as input, return bulk of data

1.CONSUMER -> single argument as input , not return anything
 BICONSUMER -> TWO argument as input , not return anything
 
 2. 2.PREDICATE -> single argument as input, return BOOLEAN 
 BIPREDICATE -> TWO argument as input ,  return BOOLEAN 

STREAMS:

INTERMEDIATE OPERATION-> OPTIONAL , CAN HAVE 0, OR 1 OR MORE THAN 1 
TERMINAL OPERATION -> ONLY ONE TERMINAL OPERATION 

FILTER FIRST, SORT THEN -> GOOD PRACTICE 


--------------TASKS----------------------

consumer:
1. try consumer with integer input and do some operations
2. try consumer with string input and do some operations
3. try andThen method in consumer
biconsumer:
4. repeat the above 3 exercises for biconsumer as well


PREDICATE:

 1 Write a predicate to check the length of given string is greater than 3 or not.
2. try exploring, and or, test methods in predicate 
3. try exploring bipredicate as well
